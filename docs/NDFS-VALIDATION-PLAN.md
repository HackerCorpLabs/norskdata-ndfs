# NDFS Cross-Implementation Validation Plan

**Goal:** prove — with exhaustive, adversarial unit tests — that four NDFS
implementations behave **identically to RetroCore's NDFS**, which is the
known-good reference that produces files SINTRAN can actually open.

**Implementations under test**

| ID | Language | Location | Role |
|----|----------|----------|------|
| **RC** | C# | `RetroCore/Emulated.Utilities/ND/FileSystem` | **Golden reference** (authoritative; known-correct) |
| RFS | C# | `RetroFS/src/RetroFS.NDFS` | Must align with RC |
| C | C99 | `norskdata-ndfs/ndfs-c` | Must align with RC |
| TS | TypeScript | `norskdata-ndfs/ndfs-ts` | Must align with RC |
| PY | Python | `norskdata-ndfs/ndfs-py` | Must align with RC |

**Secondary oracles** (independent third implementations, for cross-checking
listings/dates only): Tor Arntsen's `ndfs` CLI (WSL `/usr/local/sbin/ndfs`,
source `~/repos/ndfs/ndfs-tool`), and a live **SINTRAN** under the nd100x
emulator (ultimate acceptance oracle).

**Non-negotiable testing principles**
1. RC is the source of truth. When an implementation disagrees with RC, the
   implementation is wrong — **fix the code, never weaken the test**.
2. Every behaviour is pinned by a test that would **fail** if the behaviour
   regressed (byte-level where on-disk format is involved).
3. For every "X works" test there is a paired **negative** test proving the
   illegal/edge variant **fails the right way** (correct error, no crash, no
   silent corruption).
4. Golden byte-vectors are generated from RC and committed as fixtures; all
   other implementations must reproduce them byte-for-byte (or a divergence is
   explicitly documented and justified).

---

## Phase 0 — Characterise the RetroCore reference (the "golden spec")

Produce an authoritative, byte-level specification of every NDFS operation by
reading RC's `NDDiskBlock`, `ObjectEntry`, `UserEntry`/`UserFile`,
`MasterBlock`, `BitFile`, `BlockPointer`, `ObjectFile` and the XAT/property-bag
serializer. Deliverable: `docs/NDFS-GOLDEN-SPEC.md` capturing, with exact
offsets/encodings:

- **ObjectEntry** (64 B): header word; name@2; type@18; next/prev version@22/24;
  access@26; file-type flags@28; device@30; file-type code@32;
  object index word@34 (`user<<8 | slot`); current/total open@36/38;
  dates@40/44/48; pages@52; bytes-1@56; file pointer@60.
- **Version semantics**: a single-version file has `next = prev = ownIndex`;
  document how additional versions chain and how SINTRAN renders `;N`.
- **Object index scheme**: `slot = indexBlockPtr*32 + entry`, capped at 255;
  what happens at the 256th file per user (RC returns false → must error).
- **UserEntry** (64 B): name@2; password@18; dates@20/24; reserved@28; used@32;
  dir index@36; user index@37; **default access@40**; **friends@48** (8×2);
  byte 47 mxobl/acobl nibbles.
- **MasterBlock**/extended info, **BitFile** (contiguous), **BlockPointer**
  (type in bits 31:30, id in 29:0), allocation (contiguous/indexed/subindexed,
  sparse holes = id 0).
- **XAT** JSON schema: exact keys, value encodings, which fields round-trip.
- **Parity**: which file types get even parity (text) vs not (binary).
- **Defaults**: new file access `0x3FF`; new user default access `0x4FF`.

Also record **known RC quirks** so we don't blindly copy bugs (e.g. RC's
extended-info has no write-back; confirm whether that matters).

**Exit criteria:** golden spec reviewed; every field has an offset, size,
encoding, and a "set on create to" value.

---

## Phase 1 — Golden corpus & fixtures

1. **Real images**: curate a representative set from `D:\ND\HDD` (floppy, SMD,
   Winchester; populated SYSTEM + multi-user; files with versions; sparse
   files). Record provenance.
2. **Synthetic golden images**: drive **RC** to generate images for each
   scenario in Phase 2/3/4 and dump them. Commit the images (or compact
   hex/base64 vectors for small ones) under `tests/fixtures/golden/`.
3. **Golden outputs**: for each fixture capture `ndfs -t/-u/-i`, full entry
   dumps, and XAT exports as expected-output text fixtures.
4. **Harness**: a small generator that, given a scenario id, yields the input
   ops + the golden image/bytes, consumed by all four test suites.

**Exit criteria:** committed corpus + a documented fixture format each language
can load.

---

## Phase 2 — Core parity matrix (positive scenarios)

Each scenario runs in **C, TS, PY, RFS** and is asserted against the **RC**
golden (byte-compare on-disk where applicable, plus semantic asserts).

| # | Scenario | Key assertions |
|---|----------|----------------|
| A | Create image (every template) | master block, extended info, bit file, empty object/user file byte-match golden |
| B | Add user | name, quota, index, default access `0x4FF`, empty friends, byte layout |
| C | Copy in a text file | name/type normalisation, user assignment, access `0x3FF`, flags=Indexed, **version self-ref**, **object index `user<<8|slot`**, pages/bytes, file pointer, **even parity applied** |
| D | Copy in a binary file | **parity NOT applied**; correct type code |
| E | Copy out (extract) | parity stripped; XAT sidecar contains every field with correct values |
| F | Delete file | object slot cleared, bitmap pages freed, quota restored, **gone after reload** |
| G | Rename | name/type updated, everything else preserved |
| H | Overwrite existing | data replaced; access/dates/version preserved |
| I | Multi-version | `ls` shows `;1`,`;2`…; version chain pointers correct vs RC/SINTRAN |
| J | XAT round-trip | export then import reproduces all metadata |
| K | Quota add/remove, password set/clear | values + byte layout |

**Exit criteria:** every cell green in all four implementations against RC.

---

## Phase 3 — Negative tests (must-fail matrix)

For each, assert the operation fails with the **correct** error and leaves the
image **uncorrupted** (no crash, no partial write):

- Write to a read-only image.
- Write exceeding the user's quota / exceeding free pages.
- Add a 257th user; add a duplicate user name.
- Create a 257th file for one user (object index overflow > 255).
- Create a duplicate file (without `--overwrite`).
- Delete / stat / chmod a non-existent file.
- Illegal filename (lowercase normalised; illegal chars rejected; >16 name,
  >4 type truncated/rejected exactly as RC does).
- `chmod` with a malformed spec / out-of-range raw value.
- Open a truncated, misaligned, or non-NDFS image (e.g. a Sun disk) → clean
  error, never a wild read.
- Corrupted master block / bad pointers / bad checksum → detected.

**Exit criteria:** each failure mode has a test; behaviour matches RC (or, where
RC is silent, a deliberate, documented policy).

---

## Phase 4 — Edge cases

- 0-byte file (→ 1 page); 1-byte; exactly 2047/2048/2049 bytes.
- Page-boundary file sizes around index/subindex limits (511/512/513 pages →
  indexed↔subindexed transition).
- Sparse files (interior zero pages → block id 0, no allocation; reads back
  zeros).
- Names using the full 16 chars / types using the full 4 (terminator handling).
- User index 255; object slot 255.
- ND dates at the 1950 epoch (value 0) and the 2013 ceiling.
- Every access-rights combination per tier (R/W/A/C/D × OWN/FRIEND/PUBLIC).
- Parity round-trip stability (strip∘set == identity for valid even-parity).

---

## Phase 5 — Cross-framework interop matrix (N×N)

For every ordered pair (writer, reader) over {RC, RFS, C, TS, PY}:
1. **Image interop**: writer creates/modifies an image; reader opens it and
   verifies files, users, metadata, parity.
2. **Byte-identity**: the same scenario performed by each writer yields a
   byte-identical image (diff against RC; any difference must be explained and
   justified, not tolerated by default).
3. **XAT interop**: XAT written by writer is consumed by reader with full
   fidelity.

**Exit criteria:** the full 5×5 grid passes for a core scenario set; deviations
documented.

---

## Phase 6 — Golden byte-vector tests

Embed small RC-generated reference images as hex/base64 in each suite. Each
implementation must **reproduce the exact bytes** for the documented op
sequence. This catches silent encoding drift that semantic tests miss (it is
how we found the user `DefaultFileAccess`@40 and version-chain bugs).

---

## Phase 7 — Listing & version rendering

- `ls`/`-t` renders the version suffix (`;1`, `;2`) consistently with RC and
  SINTRAN, including multi-version files.
- `-u` user listing matches RC (quotas, default access).
- `-i` filesystem info matches (pages, pointers, boot format).
- Validate against real images that contain versioned files.

---

## Phase 8 — SINTRAN acceptance (end-to-end oracle)

The ultimate proof: under the nd100x emulator running SINTRAN, copy a file in
with **each** tool (C ndtool, RFS, and via TS/PY-produced images) and confirm
SINTRAN can `@LIST-FILES`, open, read, and shows the correct version. Automate
where feasible; otherwise a documented manual checklist per release.

---

## Phase 9 — CI integration

- Run C/TS/PY suites (and RFS `dotnet test` for the NDFS project) on every push
  via GitHub Actions; publish results.
- Gate merges on the parity + negative matrices.
- Nightly job runs the cross-framework byte-identity grid against the golden
  corpus.

---

## Phase 10 — Triage & fix loop

For each divergence the matrix surfaces:
1. Confirm RC's behaviour is correct (cross-check Tor `ndfs` / SINTRAN if
   ambiguous — as we did for `DefaultFileAccess`@40).
2. Fix the offending implementation(s) to match RC.
3. Add/keep the failing test as a permanent regression guard.
4. Never adjust a test to make broken code pass.

---

## Test infrastructure to build

- `tests/fixtures/golden/` — RC-generated images + expected dumps (shared).
- A **scenario catalogue** (one machine-readable list of ops + expectations)
  referenced by all four suites so coverage stays in lockstep.
- A **byte-diff helper** per language that pretty-prints the first differing
  offset against a golden vector.
- RC and RFS: xUnit/NUnit projects producing the golden vectors and asserting
  RFS parity. C: extend the in-repo framework. TS: vitest. PY: pytest.

## Status of issues found

### Fixed (with regression tests), verified against RetroCore / a real disk
- ✅ ObjectEntry fields 22–51 (versioning/access/flags/device/open/dates) —
  were dropped in C/TS/PY/RFS; fixed + parser + golden byte-vector tests.
- ✅ User `DefaultFileAccess`@40 / friends@48 — ports read @38/@40 (wrong);
  fixed (verified vs real image + `ndfs`).
- ✅ **Name field encoding** — wrote a field full of `0x27`; SINTRAN expects one
  terminator + NULs, so copied-in files were invisible in SINTRAN. Fixed in
  C/TS/PY (+ golden round-trip). Proven via `ndfs` on a real SMD image.
- ✅ **Per-user object-file partition** — files for non-SYSTEM users landed in
  SYSTEM's region (flat slot). Now `findFreeUserSlot` + `ensureObjectDirPage`
  place them at `user<<8|fileEntry` and grow the user's directory page on
  demand, in C/TS/PY. Proven: a file put to BUILD is listed under BUILD by
  `ndfs`. (Supersedes the old "object-file slot allocation on create" item.)
- ✅ New-file **version chain** + object index — were 0 (SINTRAN `;2`); now
  self-referential `user<<8|slot` in C/TS/PY.
- ✅ `--rm`/delete: dispatch (`-f`), slot clearing, and **whole-emptied page
  zeroing** — deleted files no longer reappear, in C/TS/PY.
- ✅ `--dest` honored with a bare name (C).
- ✅ **>512-page files** rejected in C/PY (were corrupting the adjacent block);
  TS uses sub-indexed.
- ✅ Object header word preserved on rewrite (used/modified bits).
- ✅ **Empty file type defaulted to "DATA" on read** — `from_bytes`/`fromBytes`
  rewrote an intentionally-empty type field (e.g. `TERMINAL`: `27 00 00 00`)
  to `44 41 54 41` on the next write-back. Now the empty type is preserved
  verbatim, matching RetroCore (`ObjectEntry.FromBytes`). Fixed in C/TS/PY +
  golden empty-type round-trip tests.
- ✅ **`persist_all` rewrote the entire filesystem on every mutation** — each
  add/delete/rename/chmod/quota re-serialized *all* metadata, giving every
  write a filesystem-wide blast radius (and re-applying the empty-type bug to
  unrelated files). Replaced with **immediate, surgical per-block writes**
  matching RetroCore's `NDDiskBlock.WriteBlock` (write only the touched
  object/user/bitmap page). C/TS/PY + a combined-regression test (empty-type
  file survives an unrelated add-user).

### Verified NOT a bug (audit claim debunked against a real disk)
- ✓ **Bit-file bit ordering** — the flat byte layout (`block/8`, `bit%8`) is
  correct: every reserved/structural block reads `used` on a real SINTRAN
  disk. An audit suggested a 16-bit-word byte-swap; that would corrupt real
  disks. **No change** to `bit_file`.
- ✓ **User-entry slot mapping** — `page*32+slot` is correct: on a real 57-user
  disk, user index 32 sits at page 1/slot 0. RetroCore's `user-(user/32)*8`
  formula is the latent bug (impossible slot ≥32). **Ports unchanged.**

### Open (tracked, lower priority)
- ☐ **Master-block free count** (`unreserved_pages`@0x1C) not rewritten on
  mutation in any port → stale free count after add/delete (SINTRAN reads it).
  Fix: update + write the master-block directory word on persist (NOT the
  extended-info checksum — RetroCore never rewrites that). C/TS/PY (+RFS).
- ☐ **On-demand user-file page growth** — adding a user whose user-file page is
  not yet allocated silently drops it (edge: >32 users). Mirror
  `ensureObjectDirPage` as `ensureUserDirPage` in C/TS/PY.
- ☐ **Sparse-file accounting** — ports set `pages_in_file`/`pages_used` to the
  logical page count incl. holes + the index block; RetroCore counts only
  allocated data pages and excludes the index block from user quota. Diverges
  only for sparse files.
- ☐ **RFS C#** — apply the per-user partition, version chain, name-terminator,
  delete-clear, and >512 guards to RetroFS too; audit its `UserEntry`/`UserFile`.
- ☐ **RetroCore** `UserFile.cs:240` `*8` user-slot formula is latently buggy
  for ≥32 users (report upstream; ports already correct).
- ☐ Sub-indexed file **creation** in C/PY (currently rejected >512 pages).
- ☐ Real ND creation **date** on new files (currently 0 → `1950-01-01`); needs
  an ND-timestamp encoder in libndfs.
- ☐ Multi-version create/read — **VERY LOW PRIORITY** (single-version `;1` is
  exact; chained-version ordinal best-effort/unvalidated).
