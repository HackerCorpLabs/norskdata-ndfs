/**
 * Portable shell-style wildcard matching for NDFS names.
 *
 * Supports two wildcards:
 *   '*'  matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence)
 *   '?'  matches exactly one character
 *
 * There is no support for character classes ('[...]') or path-separator
 * awareness -- matching is performed over the whole candidate string. The
 * caller is responsible for splitting NDFS paths (e.g. "USER/NAME:TYPE") into
 * the components it wants to match separately.
 *
 * This is implemented in-library (rather than relying on POSIX fnmatch, which
 * is unavailable on MinGW) so all platforms and all language ports behave
 * identically.
