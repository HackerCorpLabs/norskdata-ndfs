/**
 * NDFS error types that callers need to tell apart.
 *
 * The one distinction that matters to a user interface is between a limit an
 * operator can lift and a limit nobody can lift:
 *
 *  - SOFT: the user has filled every object block their maximum ALLOWS, but that
 *    maximum is still below the SINTRAN ceiling of 16. Granting more blocks
 *    fixes it - `@GIVE-OBJECT-BLOCKS` on a real machine, or
 *    {@link NdfsFileSystem.giveObjectBlocks} here.
 *  - HARD: the user already has all 16 object blocks, i.e. 4096 files. There is
 *    nothing to grant; the only remedy is deleting files or another user area.
 *
 * A copy or import loop that stops on {@link ObjectBlockLimitError} can print the
 * right advice by reading {@link ObjectBlockLimitError.isHardLimit} instead of
 * matching on message text.
