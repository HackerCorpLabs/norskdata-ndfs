        block at group 2. Creating files for user 136 - whose HOME is group 2 slot 8 -
        moved user 8's overflow to group 3; then creating files for user 200, whose home
        is group 3 slot 8, moved it again to group 4. All 300 files survived every move,
        and SINTRAN reported them throughout as FILE 0..299.

        A user's blocks always sit at the same slot ``user % 64``; only the group varies.
        The home group ``user // 64`` holds block 0, and overflow blocks take the same

        produced file numbers 0..255 and then 1024..1067, where SINTRAN says 256..299. It
        looked right on the earlier BIGMAN pack only because nothing had displaced that
