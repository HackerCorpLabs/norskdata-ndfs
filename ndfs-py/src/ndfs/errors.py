"""
NDFS error types that callers need to tell apart.

The one distinction that matters to a user interface is between a limit the
operator can lift and a limit nobody can lift:

  * SOFT - the user has filled every object block ALLOCATED to them and every
    block their maximum ALLOWS, but that maximum is still below the SINTRAN
    ceiling of 16. Granting more blocks fixes it. On a real machine that is
    ``@GIVE-OBJECT-BLOCKS <user>,<count>``; in this library it is
    ``NdfsFileSystem.give_object_blocks(user, count)``.

  * HARD - the user already has all 16 object blocks, i.e. 4096 files. There is
    nothing to grant. The only remedy is deleting files or using another user
    area.

A copy or import loop that stops on ``ObjectBlockLimitError`` can therefore
print the right advice by looking at :attr:`ObjectBlockLimitError.is_hard_limit`
instead of matching on message text.

Both derive from ``OSError`` (``IOError``) because that is what the file-system
layer raised for a full object table before object blocks were understood, and
existing callers catch it.
