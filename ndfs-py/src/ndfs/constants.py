# A SINTRAN user area holds 256 files per "object block": one block by default
# and up to 16 (4096 files) on version K. @GIVE-OBJECT-BLOCKS raises the
# ceiling, @USER-STATISTICS reports it as MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FILES, and blocks
# are allocated on demand as files are created. The counts live in user-entry
# byte 47 as two zero-based nibbles (high = MXOBL-1, low = ACOBL-1).
