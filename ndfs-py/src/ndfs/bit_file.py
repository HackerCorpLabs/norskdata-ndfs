        Page N lives in 16-bit WORD N/16, at bit N%16 counting from the LSB.

        AUTHORITY: SINTRAN III System Supervisor, ND-30.003.007 EN, appendix F.2
        "Bit-File"::

            PAGE = BLOCK*400B + WORD*20B + BIT

        20B is 16 decimal, so ONE 16-BIT WORD MAPS 16 PAGES - not one byte mapping 8.
        And because the formula ADDS the bit number, page x sits at bit 0, the least
        significant bit. The Norwegian edition (ND-30.003.7 NO) carries the identical
        formula, and SINTRAN's own allocator agrees: TPAGF at 51043B forms the word
        index with ``SHA ZIN SHR 4``, i.e. page/16.

        The image is big-endian, so the word at index w occupies bytes w*2 (high) and
        w*2+1 (low). Page N therefore lands in the OTHER byte of the pair from where a
        naive "byte N/8, bit N%8" scheme would put it, which reduces to flipping the
        low bit of the byte index.

        WHY THIS MATTERS: this library previously used the naive byte scheme. Wrong in
        both reader and writer, it was self-consistent and every round-trip test
        passed - but on a pack written by real SINTRAN it reads the allocation map with
        every byte pair swapped. Measured on three genuine ND media (a 78 MB pack and
        two ND distribution floppies), the naive scheme reports 32, 4 and 3 pages that
        demonstrably hold file data as FREE; this scheme reports none. Handing those
        pages out would have overwritten live files.
