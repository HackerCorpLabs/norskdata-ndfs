"""Bit-file bit ordering, checked against sources OUTSIDE this codebase.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
Until 2026-08-02 every port here addressed the bit file as "byte N/8, bit N%8".
SINTRAN actually addresses it as a 16-bit WORD: page N is bit N%16 of word N/16. On a
big-endian image those two differ by a byte swap inside every word.

The bug survived a full test suite for months. Understanding why is the point of this
file:

  1. Every existing test was a ROUND TRIP - written with convention X, read back with
     convention X. That passes for any self-consistent X, including a wrong one. A
     symmetric error is invisible to symmetric tests.
  2. The one check made against real data was a POPCOUNT comparison, and popcount is
     invariant under byte-swapping. It could not fail for this bug even in principle,
     yet it is what the docs cited as "VERIFIED".
  3. The tests were written from the same incorrect note as the code, so they asserted
     the bug as though it were the specification - ``bytes([0xFF, 0x00])  # first 8
     used`` in test_bit_file.py said exactly that.

So every test below is deliberately ASYMMETRIC: it compares this code against something
this project did not produce - ND's own manual, SINTRAN's own allocator, or a pack real
SINTRAN wrote. Nothing here round-trips our own output.

AUTHORITY
=========
SINTRAN III System Supervisor, ND-30.003.007 EN, appendix F.2 "Bit-File"::

    PAGE = BLOCK*400B + WORD*20B + BIT

20B is 16 decimal, so one 16-bit word maps 16 pages; and because the formula ADDS the
bit number, page x sits at bit 0 - the least significant bit. The Norwegian edition
ND-30.003.7 NO carries the identical formula. SINTRAN's own allocator agrees: TPAGF at
51043B forms the word index with ``SHA ZIN SHR 4``, i.e. page/16, not page/8.
