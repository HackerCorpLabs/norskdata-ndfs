"""
Real-write regression tests for the NDFS object file (the volume-wide
directory listing every file across every user) growing past its plain-
Indexed capacity of 512 directory pages (16,384 files total, or 64 users
at MAX_USER_FILE_POINTERS==8 reserved index-pointer slots each).

Previously `_ensure_object_dir_page`'s Indexed branch had no bounds check:
once page_idx reached MAX_OBJECT_FILE_POINTERS (512) it would compute an
out-of-range offset into a single 2048-byte index page and blow up. Fixed
by growing the object file into a SubIndexed structure on first need (one-
time conversion: allocate a fresh sub-index block, install the existing
Indexed block as its slot-0 entry with no data migration, repoint the
master block at the new sub-index block, persist), then falling through to
the already-correct SubIndexed handling. Mirrors the equivalent fix already
applied to RetroFS.NDFS.FileSystems.NdfsFileSystem.EnsureObjectDirPage in
the C# port (see NdfsObjectDirectorySubIndexedGrowthTests.cs).

The read side (ObjectFile.load_from_pages) and the per-write persist path
(_object_page_block / _write_object_page) were already correct for both
Indexed and SubIndexed object-file layouts before this change -- only the
allocate-on-demand conversion was missing.
