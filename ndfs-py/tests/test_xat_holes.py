"""
Tests for the sparse-hole map in XAT sidecars.

A sparse file has pages that were never allocated. Nothing in the sidecar said
WHERE they were: pages_in_file and bytes_in_file together reveal THAT a file is
sparse, but not the positions, so a file copied out to a host and back returned
with a different layout. XAT_HOLES records them.

The behaviour these tests pin was measured on real hardware, not invented: the
file (SYSTEM)S3-CONFIG-E01:PROG on a live pack has 89 real pages spread over a
99-page extent with holes at 54..63, and transferring it between two ND-100s
sends 89 messages carrying page numbers 0..53 then 64..98.
